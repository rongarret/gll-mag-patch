The basis for this document is the RCA          1802 COSMAC code which was compiled and dumped into files for text processing.          Suggestions on restructuring blocks etc are invited but the basic screen format          will be retained to reduce typographical errors. Please indicate areas where          expanded comments would be useful in understanding the use of the routines. It          is assumed that the reader is already familiar with the FORTH programming style          and knows about the basic operations of the magnetometer.                  From a Software point of view the Magnetometer can be controlled entirely          by storing the appropriate codes into specific memory locations. The codes used          for most of these softswitches are:                      AA - Turns the switch OFF                     BB - Turns the switch ON           The memory locations used and the function that they control are:                              70yy MUX/ADC CONTROL/DATA                                 Y7 Bit not used                                 Y6-Y3 Channel Select for MUX                                 Y2-Y0 DATA SEL,START ADC                                         0 READ ADC LSB / WRITE SELECT CHANNEL                                         1 READ ADC MSB / WRITE START ADC                                         4 READ STATUS                              72X0 MULTIPLIER WRITE X                            72X1 MULTIPLIER WRITE Y, START MPY                            72X2 READ LSB OF RESULT                            72X3 READ MSB OF RESULT                              74F0 RAM/ROM Memory Switch                            74F1 INBOARD MAG POWER                            74F2 OUTBOARD MAG POWER                            74F3 INBOARD HIGH GAIN                            74F4 OUTBOARD HIGH GAIN                            74F5 INTERNAL CALIBRATE                            74F6 FLIPPER POWER                                                74F8 INBOARD FLIP LEFT                            74F9 OUTBOARD FLIP LEFT                            74FA INBOARD FLIP RIGHT                            74FB OUTBOARD FLIP RIGHT                             75XX READ HARDWARE COUNTER                             77X0 Protect RAM Page 40XX                            77X1 Protect RAM Page 41XX                             ..  ..  ..  ..  ..                                           -1-             MAGNETOMETER                     SOFTWARE NOTES                      PRELIMINARY                               ..  ..  ..  ..  ..                             77X6 Protect RAM Page 46XX                            77X7 Protect RAM Page 47XX           The above controls respond only to the ON/OFF bytes AB/AA.

Current S/C Time is received during RTI 8 in locations 4E20-4E26.                  2.  The instruments recognizes the time while processing RTI 9 interrupt                 3.  During interrupt processing for RTI 0, the time is transferred to                    locations 4EE0 - 4EE6 for use by the FORTH program as follows:                           4EE5 - MOD10 count starts at 9 and counts to 29 4EE4 - MOD91                         count must be incremented by one to get current time 4EE3-4EE1 -                         S/C Frame count                                                                                     -3-             MAGNETOMETER                  INTERRUPT HANDLING                 Interrupts are generated by a counter in the MAG and by RTI pulses which          reset this counter. The external flag bit 1 on the 1802 is set if the interrupt          is generated by the RTI pulse. The counter is set such that equal spaced 30 Hz          interrupts are produced.  The interrupt routine does the following operations:                     1. Decrement Reg 4                    2. Save STATUS,ACC,CF,REG'S 2,3,4,9,A                    3. Sample Analog Data                    4. If RTI interrupt check for time,command                    5. If Snapshot ON store analog data                    6. Filter INB and OUT MAG Data                    7. Add 1 to 4EE5                    8.

Wimble BYTE Feb. 1979                           The commands utilized by GALILEO are designed to utilize                        a 4 bit nybble with 4 bits of parity utilizing hamming codes.                         This coding enables one to correct single bit errors and                        detect double bit errors in data received from the CDS.                            The four parity bits are defined as follows:                                P4 is the parity of all 8 bits ( P4=1 for odd parity)                               P3 is the parity of the above word ANDED with 27                               P2 is the parity of the above word ANDED with 4B                               P1 is the parity of the above word ANDED with 8D                                            If all the parity bits = 0 then there was no error detected.                         If P4 = 0 and some other P = 1 then 2 bit errors have                        occured and the data must be discarded.                         If P4 = 1 then the data can be corrected .                                         306 SCREEN                          ( HAMMING ERROR CORRECTING DESCRIPTION PG 2 ) ;S                                               If P4 = 1 then a correctable error has occurred.
